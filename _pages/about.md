Short Bio
======
I am TAN XUAN(谭旋), a second-year graduate student at [Hangzhou University of Science and Technology](http://zhaosheng.hdu.edu.cn/). My area of expertise is in face synthesis, and I am currently conducting research on face privacy protection. 

In my current research, I am focused on developing innovative methods to protect people's privacy in the age of facial recognition. With the proliferation of cameras and facial recognition software, it has become increasingly important to safeguard individuals' privacy rights. I believe that my work has the potential to make a significant impact in this area.
